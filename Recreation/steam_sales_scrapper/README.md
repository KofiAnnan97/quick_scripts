# Steam Sales Scrapper
The purpose of this script is to scrape the Steam Web API to determine whether a game has reached a specified price threshold. If one or more games fall below the user-defined limit an email will be sent containing a list of games along with their respective prices.

## Quick Start
1. Setup SMTP server/service (TLS required/optional)
2. Nagivate to project folder and run `cargo build`
3. In the project folder, create `.env` with the following:
    ```
    DOMAIN={your_domain}
    STEAM_API_KEY={your_steam_api_key}
    RECIPIENT_EMAIL={destination_email_address}
    SMTP_HOST={smtp_host_domain}
    SMTP_PORT={port_number}
    SMTP_EMAIL={smtp_email_address}
    SMTP_USERNAME={smtp_username}
    SMTP_PWD={stmp_password}
    ```
4. Run one the commands below (supports commands from cargo).
5. [Optional] Tweak and run set_cron.sh (for Unix-based systems) to automate when and how often the script is run.

## Supported Commands
Use the`--help` flag in command line to get more information on the supported commands. Here's a brief description and example of each command.
- `SEARCH` := find a game title based on keyphrase and add game with price threshold.
    ```bash 
    steam_sales_scrapper search --keyphrase <keyphrase>
    ```
- `ADD` := add a specified game (title must be exact to work).
    ```bash 
    steam_sales_scrapper add --title <title> --price <price>
    ```
- `UPDATE` := update price threshold for a specified game.
    ```bash 
    steam_sales_scrapper update --title <title> --price <price>
    ```
- `REMOVE` := remove a specified game.
    ```bash 
    steam_sales_scrapper remove --title <title>
    ```
- `LIST` := list all the stored price thresholds for selected games.
    ```bash

    ```bash 
    steam_sales_scrapper --update-cache
    ```
- `EMAIL` := sends an email (using SMTP) containing a list of games that are below user defined price threshold for each game. No email is sent if no game has reached their price threshold.
    ```bash 
    steam_sales_scrapper --send-email
    ```
